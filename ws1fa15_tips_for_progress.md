## Tips for Progress

* Get ready to be frustrated. This is an integral part of learning. Everyone makes mistakes; you will too. It is ok.

* **Keep calm and focus your study.** 

* Learn fundamentals in this order.
    * Web Concepts (client vs. server, front-end vs. back-end, ftp, etc.)
    * HTML/HTML5
    * git/github
    * CSS
    * The Reponsive Web (Media Queries)
    * Frameworks (Bootstrap and Foundation)
    * CSS Preprocessor: SASS (if you're using Foundation)
    * CSS3
    * Javascript Library (i.e. JQuery, p5.js)

* Add one thing at a time to your code until you know what the code is doing.

* Don’t give up when something gets hard. Keep at it.

* Read and/or watch everything you can (multiple resources on the same topic give you different perspectives). Watch and learn from the mistakes you make. These are prime ways to improve your skills. You will continue to learn even if you have been at it for a long time.

* View Source. Look at other people’s code and ways that they organized it. How easy is other’s code to read through?

* Learn Relative Paths.

* Acquire and Use a HTML, CSS, Framework tag list or cheat sheet. (See Resources Folder.) 
  * [Smashing Magazine's HTML5 Cheat Sheet] (http://media.mediatemple.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/images/html5-cheat-sheet/html5-cheat-sheet.pdf)
  * [Smashing Magazine's CSS Cheat Sheet] (http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/css3-cheat-sheet/css3-cheat-sheet.pdf)
  * [Foundation Cheat Sheet](https://princessdesign.net/foundation-cheat-sheet/)
  * [Bootstrap Cheat Sheet](http://creativealive.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bootstrap3-cheatsheet.pdf)

* Make sure you have closed tags and closed quotes.

* Make sure you have spelled tags correctly (that's what sublime text and the cheatsheets are for.)

* index.html in each folder (except images folder). why?
  * Server can be setup so that this is the default page within a directory
  * Shorter/Cleaner URL
  * Don’t see all of the files within a directory

* .html extension

* **Lowercase filenames**

* Be consistent in the style that you write your code. (lower case per [W3C] (http://www.w3.org/) standards)

* Title (descriptive text descriptions for browser bookmarking)

* Cross Browser and Device Compatibility
  * Test on as many browsers and devices as possible.

* Validate your code: [HTML5 Validator](http://validator.w3.org) and [CSS Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator)

* Comment your code! 

* Make sure your links work. Test! Test! Test!
