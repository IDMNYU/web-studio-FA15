## UX ASSIGNMENT

Refer to http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/information_architecture_tutorial for more detailed information. Should be 1 or 2 pages maximum. Be clear, concise, and to the point.

**Bring your work to class on Thursday to review**

**Deliverable 1: Create a Wireframe**
Create a 1024x768 wireframe for the front page of the site you are building for your final project. <a href="http://www.raincreativelab.com/paperbrowser/downloads/DS1panel_w_notes-landscape.pdf" target="_blank">Download and print out this template</a> to use as your sketching surface.

Be sure to include at least a section for your header, body and footer. Within each of these main sections, I’ve outlined a few areas below that you may or may not have, depending on the details of your project:

Header
- logo
- search bar
- navigation bar

Body
- images
- multimedia (videos, audio)
- text
- text fields (forms)

Footer
- copyright
- any legal links

Keep these things in mind when making your wireframes:
Wireframes are blueprints for your site. They help you figure out the structure of your site, and therefore your HTML. They also help you identify what kind of functionality you will need to build into your site. They are also used to show ‘state’. ‘State’ is basically different modes of representation for certain elements on your site. For example, a button can have a rollover state and rollout state. A textfield on a form can have a normal state and an error state.

Do not worry about graphic design at this point, including fonts, colors, or images. Wireframes should be black and white (or greyscale), with a nondescript font simply used to label areas of the wireframes. You can use shades of grey to indicate different button states. Image areas can be represented by a box with an X across it.

Keeping the above in mind, reference <a href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-wireframing--webdesign-7399" target="_blank">this page</a> for more guidance in building your wireframe, paying particular attention to the introduction and steps 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7.

I skipped step 3, because we are focusing on using pencil and paper for now. You are of course welcome to use a graphics application if you have one that you like and are comfortable with.

**Deliverable 2: Create a Paper Prototype**
After you have made your wireframe, translate it into a paper prototype. This is essentially taking the elements from your wireframe and creating cut-outs of the elements and taping them to a piece of paper in order to move them around to figure out the best layout.

For the assignment, use another print out of <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/ux/how-prototype-websites-paper-31514246" target="_blank">the template found here</a>.

Cut out strips of paper for the elements on your page. These could include (but not limited to):
- navigation, including dropdown sub-menus
- image areas
- text areas
- overlays
- buttons for social media
- an area where you want to load tweets
- audio/video areas

You can also use index cards and post-it notes to represent content areas.
